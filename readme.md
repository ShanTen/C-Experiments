# C play 

> All my experiments digging really deep into C.
> Not college affiliated.


## End Goal:
 - Embedded systems programming
 - kernel writing/low level contrib
 - Deep Computation knowledge 

## Random thoughts:
 - Hardware interfacing with C (STM32) 
 - Working with sockets and low level networking in C 
 - Writing a http server in C 
 - Writing Code using Open GL
 - Contributing to Linux Kernel or atleast UNDERSTANDING the Linux kernel
    
## Coverage:
 - Syntax and Usage => Structs, Macros, FS, Writing/Reading file buffers
 - Projects
