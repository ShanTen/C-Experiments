Preface:
Learning about memory allocation and buffers in C.

    
Learning Description:
    
1) Function - malloc(size)
    - Allocates specified amount of memory in system and returns pointer to that location.
    - Does not depend on data type
    - Allocates memory in bytes.
    
Questions:
1) Lets suppose I am running a C program (.exe) file. 
    + I have used malloc to allocate 20 bytes of memory 
    + I have not freed the memory anywhere 
    + In the middle of execution - if I ctrl+c and end the execution of the program, (.exe is not running)
      Q: Is the allocated memory still reserved in my RAM?
       A: In new operating systems (Greater than Windows NT and â€¦) it automatically gets freed 
               - Why: Because executables are assigned sectors to run in and when the executable stops running, the entire sector is called back hence it is freed.
               In old OSes and embedded that might not be the case (so avoid that :skull_fa)
               In such cases one might have to reboot/reset the system.
               
2) Will you always know the data type of what you are allocating using malloc()?
    + yes, always.
