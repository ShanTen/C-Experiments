Files: long list of numbers stored as binary on a storage device,
        it is only the way you read each list of numbers, that differentiates them.
                (Pixel wise, wave amplitude wise, ASCII/Unicode for text, etc)

Directory File : 
    Records where multiple files (collection of numbers) start and end in a storage device.
            Also length
      Usually at the front of device.
    Also stores size, creation data and modified (meta data essentially)

Primary Files
    - txt: text and strings
    - wav: audio files (meta data exists at the beginning and also specifies how large the data is)
    - bmp: bitmap files, meta data exists at the beginning. data is represented as RGB values 
                + 3 Bytes represent the 3 colors - RGB which can be used to represent the color of the pixel
              + Assume some "x" bytes required for 1 pixel, X is always >=3, the other bytes may be used for other values like transparency, etc.
